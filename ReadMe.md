## The R run_analysis.R code in this repository primarily performs these 5 functions:

    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

    Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

    Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names

    From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
